          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Gerald Hill is a software engineer that would be a valuable asset to any company.
            He is hardworking and will always be the quickest learner in the room.
            He is currently studying Computer Science at Irvine Valley College and is looking to transfer for a Bachelor's Degree.
            Gerald also has a lot of experience in high pressure situations and can think on the fly, thanks to his experience in the marching arts.
            This has taught him how to be an excellent communicator and team player.
